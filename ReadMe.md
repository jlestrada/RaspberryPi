# Raspberry Pi Code
## Jose Estrada
### May 25, 2015

This repository is intended to provide any code that I develope for my Raspberry Pi
micro-processor. Please feel free to use any of the provide code. No need to give 
credit but it is always appreciated.

Please keep in mind that a lot of the files use the wiringPi library. Gordon provides
some great functions when interfacing with the available GPIO pins on the board. The
library can be downloaded here.
